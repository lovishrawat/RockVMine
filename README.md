# Rock vs Mine Classification Project

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file (`RockVsMine.ipynb`) that demonstrates a machine learning model to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on their attributes. This project is inspired by the sonar dataset commonly used for binary classification problems in machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of sonar signals reflected off various objects. Each record contains features corresponding to energy values for different frequency bands and the labels (Rock or Mine).

- **Source**: The dataset is widely available in the public domain, often used for machine learning demonstrations.

## Features of the Project
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into the data distribution and feature importance.
- **Model Training**: Building and training machine learning models for classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

Install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RockVsMine.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd RockVsMine
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook RockVsMine.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results
The trained model is evaluated on a test dataset, achieving notable performance metrics in predicting whether an object is a rock or a mine.
